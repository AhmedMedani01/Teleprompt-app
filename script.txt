I'm Ahmed, I've been a machine learning engineer for the last 7+ years.

And I have seen a lot in these 7 years

I've spent most of my career building ML systems fully hands-on in Python, frameworks
- like PyTorch,
- scikit-learn,
- and more recently LLM-based stacks >>
- such as LangChain. Ollama vLLM

I have built production-grade ML pipelines from scratch, designed scalable architectures, and optimized models for performance.

My work has spanned across various domains including natural language processing, computer vision, and recommendation systems.

This teleprompter will help me deliver smooth presentations and videos without losing my place!
